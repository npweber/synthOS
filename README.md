# synthOS
For EDM artists starting out or stuck on a blank audio timeline, synthOS is the direct, generative music loop producer.
An android app capable of using simple, logical properties that are easy to understand to generate music loops that can be shared across the internet.
Advantagous in design to other generative music solutions on Google Play, synthOS is the simple music producer.
